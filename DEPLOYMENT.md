# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Secrets Web Application

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your Secrets Web Application to Render.com, as requested in the project requirements.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- [x] Completed application development
- [x] Tested locally (`npm start`)
- [x] Committed all code to GitHub
- [x] Created a GitHub repository
- [x] Updated README.md with project details

## 🌐 Deploying to Render

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Ensure your `package.json` has the correct scripts**
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node index.js",
       "dev": "nodemon index.js"
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 2: Create Render Account

1. Visit [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click "Get Started for Free"
3. Sign up with your GitHub account
4. Verify your email address

### Step 3: Connect Your Repository

1. **Dashboard Setup**
   - Click "New +" button
   - Select "Web Service"
   - Choose "Build and deploy from a Git repository"
   - Click "Next"

2. **Connect GitHub**
   - Click "Connect GitHub"
   - Authorize Render to access your repositories
   - Select your secrets-web-app repository

### Step 4: Configure Your Web Service

1. **Basic Settings**
   ```
   Name: secrets-web-app
   Environment: Node
   Region: Choose closest to your users
   Branch: main (or master)
   ```

2. **Build & Deploy Settings**
   ```
   Build Command: npm install
   Start Command: npm start
   ```

3. **Advanced Settings (Important!)**
   ```
   Node Version: 18 (or latest LTS)
   Health Check Path: /
   ```

### Step 5: Environment Variables

Add these environment variables in Render:

```
NODE_ENV = production
JWT_SECRET = [Generate a strong secret - Render can auto-generate]
PORT = [Leave empty - Render sets automatically]
```

**To generate JWT_SECRET:**
- Use Render's "Generate" button, or
- Generate manually: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"`

### Step 6: Deploy

1. Click "Create Web Service"
2. Wait for the build and deployment process
3. Monitor the build logs for any errors
4. Once deployed, you'll receive a live URL like: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### Test Your Live Application

1. **Registration Test**
   - Visit your live URL
   - Register a new account
   - Verify email validation works
   - Test password requirements

2. **Login Test**
   - Login with your registered account
   - Verify JWT authentication works
   - Check dashboard displays user info

3. **Security Test**
   - Try accessing `/dashboard` without login
   - Verify redirect to login page
   - Test logout functionality

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Verify mobile navigation works

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

**Issue**: `npm install` fails
```bash
# Solution: Check package.json dependencies
# Ensure all dependencies are in "dependencies" not "devDependencies"
```

**Issue**: Node version mismatch
```bash
# Solution: Add engines to package.json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=14.0.0"
}
```

### Runtime Errors

**Issue**: Application won't start
- Check start command is `node index.js`
- Verify main server file is named `index.js`
- Check environment variables are set

**Issue**: 404 errors on routes
- Verify all EJS templates are in `/views` folder
- Check static files are in `/public` folder
- Ensure proper route definitions

### Environment Issues

**Issue**: JWT authentication fails
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set in environment variables
- Check cookie settings for production
- Ensure secure flags are properly configured

## 🔄 Updating Your Deployment

### Automatic Deployments

Render automatically redeploys when you push to your connected branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature X"
git push origin main
# Render will automatically redeploy
```

### Manual Deployments

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your web service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

## 📊 Monitoring Your Application

### Render Dashboard Features

1. **Logs**: View real-time application logs
2. **Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory usage
3. **Events**: Track deployment history
4. **Settings**: Update configuration

### Health Checks

Render automatically monitors your app at the health check path (`/`):
- Green: Application is healthy
- Red: Application is down or unresponsive

## 💡 Performance Optimization

### Production Best Practices

1. **Enable Compression**
   ```javascript
   const compression = require('compression');
   app.use(compression());
   ```

2. **Security Headers**
   ```javascript
   const helmet = require('helmet');
   app.use(helmet());
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting**
   ```javascript
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   const limiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   });
   app.use(limiter);
   ```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Production Security Checklist

- [x] JWT_SECRET is strong and unique
- [x] Cookies are configured with secure flags
- [x] Input validation is comprehensive
